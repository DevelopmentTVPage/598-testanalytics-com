    "description": "No matter what they say, ALL other vacuums lose suction. Only Dyson Cinetic\u2122 science doesn\u2019t1. See how Dyson Cinetic removes the need for a filter that will eventually clog, even after regular filter washing.\n\n1Historically, manufacturers based \u201cno loss of suction\u201d claims on a single test that can be completed before a vacuum\u2019s bin is full. We repeat that test to bin full 100s of times consecutively, amounting to 10 years\u2019 worth of test dust, to ensure vacuums containing Dyson Cinetic\u2122 science maintain constant suction.",
