    "description": "Designed to look like a ship's helm, the Mariner is a great gift for those who love boating. Four cheese tools are secured in magnetic slots evenly spaced on the side of the board, their wooden handles resembling those of a ship's helm. Four stationary handles on the side of the board help to \"steer\" the helm as the board rotates like a mini lazy Susan.\n\n1-9\" round rubberwood cutting board with a thin groove on the top surface to catch whey\nbrine or juice run-off; 4 tempered stainless steel cheese tools with rubberwood handles: 1 crumbly cheese chisel knife\n1 cheese fork\n1 blunt-tipped cheese knife\nand 1 pointed-tip cheese knife",
