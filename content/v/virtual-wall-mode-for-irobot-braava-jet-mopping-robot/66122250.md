    "description": "This is an instructional video on using the Virtual Wall\u00ae Mode for your iRobot\u00ae Braava jet Mopping Robot. To prevent Braava jet\u2122 from going into other rooms, an invisible barrier can be created with Virtual Wall\u00ae Mode so that the robot will avoid cleaning part of a room or a different floor type. You can also use Virtual Wall Mode to divide a larger room into smaller areas to help Braava jet clean more efficiently.",
