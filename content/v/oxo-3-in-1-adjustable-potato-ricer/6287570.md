    "description": "Don't limit yourself to just potatoes with the OXO Good Grips 3-in-1 Adjustable Potato Ricer. This patented Ricer has three settings, easily changed with the twist of the dial, for many cooking tasks. While the fine setting is perfect for fluffy mashed potatoes, it's also great for parsnips, carrots, turnips, gnocchi and more. The medium setting is ideal for spaetzle and pressing water out of cooked greens, and the coarse setting is perfect for chunky applesauce, egg salad and pressing tomatoes for sauce. Since the disks are attached, there is no need to go searching for extra parts when you want to adjust settings. The brushed stainless steel Ricer comes apart for easy cleaning and has soft, comfortable non-slip grips.",
