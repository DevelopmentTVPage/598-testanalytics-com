    "description": "The Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Big Easy Oil-less Fryer\n\nYes, it's hard to believe: frying a food without oil, but that's just what The Big Easy does. Using Char-Broil TRU-Infrared heat, The Big Easy \"fries\" the meat AND locks in the natural juices, which are often lost in the roasting and frying process. \n\nYour meat comes out golden brown, juicy and delicious without the danger of hot oil to splatter or spill. There's no extra expense for gallons of oil, or the headache of disposal once the oil is cool. The Big Easy is large enough to cook up to a 16 pound turkey and there's even a drip pan to catch the drippings necessary for gravy and other recipes. \n\nTo get started, simply connect The Big Easy to a 20 pound propane tank. The easy-on\/off controls are already pre-set to the ideal temperature and since there's almost no assembly required, you're ready to cook with no fuss. When you're done, there are no messy pans to clean up either! Now you see why it's called The Big Easy. Couldn't you use something this \"Easy\" in your life?",
