    "description": "A celebration of individuals whose generosity, hard work and connection with nature inspire us every day.\n\nRebecca Burgess is a revitalizer of natural dyeing techniques, ecological restoration educator, textile artist, author of the book \"Harvesting Color\" and founder of Ecologicalarts and the Fibershed Project in Mill Valley, California. Mary Pettis-Sarley is trained in textile and visual design. She has been ranching for over 30 years and combines her love of fiber and ranching. Her ranch includes several breeds of sheep, angora goats, llamas and alpacas that she blends to form yarns that are made at Yolo Wool Mill.\n\nWe've always been inspired by the Midwest Backyard Garden. It's a place that brings us joy-where we connect with family and friends. Grow inspired is a seasonal celebration that recognizes our neighbors who share their passion for gardening, nature and the great outdoors with their community.",
