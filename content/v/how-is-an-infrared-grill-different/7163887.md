    "description": "The Char-Broil\u00ae TRU-Infrared\u2122 Difference:\n\nThe science behind TRU-Infrared tells a juicy story. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying, locking in natural juices and flavors.",
