    "description": "Entirely self-taught, Heston Blumenthal is the most progressive chef of his generation. In this video he explains why few things have the ability to create as much mess as waffle batter, because you can't control where the batter goes. Heston takes us through the Breville Smart Waffle, which has a moat that not only catches the overflow but cooks it, at the same time making clean up faster and simpler than ever before.",
