    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Deep Clean Brush Set features two brushes for easily scrubbing all the hard-to-clean places where dirt builds up. Both Brushes feature sturdy nylon bristles and soft, comfortable non-slip grips. The Large Brush is sized and angled perfectly for scrubbing grout, shower door tracks, stove tops and more. The soft, non-slip thumb pad on the back of the bristle head allows for optimal comfort when applying maximum scrubbing force. The Small Brush, with its compact bristle head and pointed bristle profile, is great for cleaning in and around fixtures, thin grout lines and other tight spaces. It also features a built-in wiper blade that removes built up dirt from drains and other crevices.",
