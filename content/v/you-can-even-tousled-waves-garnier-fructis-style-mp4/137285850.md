    "description": "Fake a little volume and get that piece-y undone look (no beach necessary).\n\nStep One: Apply a heat protectant like Fructis Flat Iron Perfector to prep hair for styling.  \n\nStep Two: Take your first section of hair and wrap it around the barrel, starting as high or as low on your hair as you\u2019d like. Hold it on the hair for 3-5 seconds, working from back to front, doing one half of your head at a time.  For a beachier look, alternate wrapping sections towards and away from your face. \n\nStep Three: Once you\u2019ve reached the end, give curls a soft shake and comb through with fingers. TIP: For some great lift at the root, use a small teasing comb which will help you target carefully. \n\nStep Four: Finish with a generous spritz of Fructis Style Volume Anti-Humidity Hairspray.\n\nLearn more about Fructis Style: http:\/\/www.garnierusa.com\/products\/styling.aspx\n\nFind us on Instagram! @garnierusa http:\/\/instagram.com\/garnierusa\nLike us on Facebook! https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/garnierusa\nFollow us on Twitter! @garnierusa https:\/\/twitter.com\/garnierusa",
