    "description": "\"Mind of a Chef Techniques with Sean Brock\" is a video series that highlights the quintessential spirit of Chef Sean Brock's culinary ideas, themes, and techniques.\n\nThree ingredients form the base of this easy Peach Ice Cream -- although the end result is anything but simple.  And because peaches simply aren't Southern enough, the finished frozen concoction is topped with a sweet cornbread crumble.",
