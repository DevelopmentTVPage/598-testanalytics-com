    "description": "Blendtec founder and CEO, Tom Dickson, visits the set of Bloomberg's \"With All Due Respect\"and takes on the U.S. political scene and asks the important question...\"Will it Blend?\" Watch Tom pulverize Hillary's Blackberry and emails faster than Hillary already did. Also watch Tom blend President Barack Obama's golf club, Senator and Republican 2016 Presidential hopeful Ted Cruz's Canadian identity, and Speaker of the House John Boehner's suntan lotion (that he never uses). Why did we do this? Because pulverizing politics can be quite a rush! \n\nMany thanks to Bloomberg's \"With All Due Respect\" hosts Mark Halperin and John Heilemann and the folks at Bloomberg who are big \"Will it Blend\" fans! We love you guys!",
