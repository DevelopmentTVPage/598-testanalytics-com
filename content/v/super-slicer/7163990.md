    "description": "W\u00dcSTHOF\u2019S best-selling collection for generations, CLASSIC full-tang knives are precision-forged from a single piece of an exclusive high-carbon stain-free steel. CLASSIC knives feature a new handle design made of a highly durable synthetic material \u2013 Polyoxymethylene (POM) \u2013 which has a tighter molecular structure to resist fading and discoloration.\n\nThe 10\" Super Slicer is a long slender blade with a rounded tip. The blade is longer than many other knives so that it can slice across large roasts in one swift movement. The scalloped edge cuts though meat such as turkey without damaging it, bread without compressing it and tomatoes without squashing them.",
