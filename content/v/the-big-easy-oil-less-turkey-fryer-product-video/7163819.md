    "description": "Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared oil-less turkey fryer is the safer, healthier way to fry your turkey.\n\nThe infrared heat circles the cooker to penetrate the meat evenly and seal in juices. The result is a bird that's moist inside and crispy outside but without the risk, hassle or added fat and calories of oil. Safely cook a turkey (up to 16 lbs.) or chicken in about 8 to 10 minutes per pound - no waiting for the oil to heat up. Roasts and most other large cuts of meat cook for slightly longer.",
