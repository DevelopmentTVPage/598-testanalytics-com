    "description": "Setting The Power Level On The Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Big Easy 2-in-1 Electric Smoker & Roaster\n\nThe Big Easy TRU-Infrared\u2122 Smoker & Roaster features 15 Power Levels that make it an extremely versatile outdoor cooking appliance. \n\nReference the Temperature Chart to set the correct Power Level depending on outdoor weather conditions. If you are cooking on a colder or windy day, use a Power Level on the higher side of the temperature range. Setting the correct Power Level isn't an exact science and is part of the fun of outdoor cooking.  If you find your food is cooking faster or slower than you like, simply adjust the power level accordingly. \n\nTo set the power level, press and hold either the (+) or (-) Temperature Control Button for 2 seconds to scroll rapidly through the temperatures. \n\nYou can also step through the power levels slowly by just pressing once to advance power levels higher or lower.",
