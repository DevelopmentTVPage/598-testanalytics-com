    "description": "Fill, measure and pour with ease with the OXO Good Grips Angled Measuring Bucket. The patented top-view angled surface measures gallons and quarts, eliminating guesswork when filling. Built-in measurements on the bottom of the bucket provide added convenience when measuring smaller amounts of detergent. The large opening accommodates all household mops and the wide spouts allow for controlled pouring. The soft, non-slip handle absorbs pressure from your hand, making it easier to carry and pour when the Bucket is full. The Mop Holder on the bucket handle securely holds your mop upright in storage or when moving from room to room while mopping.",
