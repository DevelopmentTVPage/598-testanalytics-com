    "description": "Get out of sticky situations with the OXO Good Grips Adjustable Measuring Cup.  This measuring cup will put an end to battles with peanut butter, honey and other sticky ingredients.  An internal track and comfortable turning knob allow the plunger in the body of the Measuring Cup to adjust smoothly to the desired measurement marking.  Simply fill the cup with your sticky ingredient and turn the knob to push it right into your mixing bowl. The plunger acts as a squeegee on inside of Cup, getting out every last bit of your ingredient. In a pinch, the Cup can also be used for wet and dry ingredients, eliminating the need for multiple sizes of measuring cups and spoons scattered throughout the kitchen.  The generous rim makes pouring ingredients easy.",
