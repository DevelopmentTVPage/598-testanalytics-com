    "description": "Marc Fosh's tip\n\nWhile not absolutely essential, it's traditional to use stale bread as part of this crust. To cut down on waste, I always recommend keeping old bread for tasty recipes like this. You can always make breadcrumbs and freeze them!\n\nThis recipe was prepared using the Braun Multiquick 5 hand blender with its chopper and whisk accessories.",
