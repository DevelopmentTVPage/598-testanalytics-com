    "description": "The Dyson V8 Absolute cord-free vacuum is engineered to clean all floor types. For deeper carpet cleaning, the direct-drive cleaner head delivers 150% more brush bar power than the Dyson V6 Animal cord-free vacuum \u2013 while the soft roller cleaner head sucks up both large debris and fine dust for complete hard floor cleaning. \n\nPowered by the Dyson digital motor V8, it generates even more suction than its predecessor. And with whole machine filtration, it captures allergens and expels cleaner air too. \n\nThanks to a revolutionary, lightweight cord-free format, it also transforms for easy cleaning up high, and transforms to a handheld for cleaning the sofa, stairs, or in the car \u2013 with an extra tool for tougher tasks. \n\nNew battery chemistry delivers up to 40 minutes of fade-free suction (up to 25 minutes with motorised floor tool attached) to clean even further, while a new hygienic bin ejector means there\u2019s no need to touch the dirt.",
