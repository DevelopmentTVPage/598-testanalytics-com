    "description": "For the Ratatouille's recipe, prepare your summer vegetables into small, evenly sized pieces for uniform cooking. Heat the olive oil with a twig of thyme and rosemary, add all the vegetables. Allow the contents to simmer slowly while stirring gently. Add some finely chopped basil at the last moment in order to give a smooth and subtle flavour. Served with chicken breast cooked in a  dutch oven,  it's delicious.",
