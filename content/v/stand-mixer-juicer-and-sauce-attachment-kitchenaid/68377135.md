    "description": "The new KitchenAid\u00ae Juicer and Sauce attachment has 3 different pulp screens so you can make everything from smooth fruit juices to savory pasta sauces\u2014powered by your KitchenAid\u00ae Stand Mixer. This masticating juicer first slices, then processes soft, hard or leafy fruits and vegetables for maximum nutrient-rich extraction. And when you\u2019re finished, the feed tube and screens can go right into the dishwasher\u2014so it\u2019s always easy to clean. Ready to get started? Learn how to assemble your attachment with our setup video. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3_Qkx-AXxqM.",
