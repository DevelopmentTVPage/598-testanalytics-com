    "description": "Give your wet laundry the wide open spaces it craves!  The OXO Good Grips Laundry Drying Center offers plenty of drying space without the need to overlap items.  The unique open structure promotes air flow for quicker drying.  It features adjustable drying bars that slide for easy loading and unloading and for customizing your drying space.  The bars are extra thick to reduce creasing.  Additional bars on either side of the Drying Center provide enough extra drying space to hold more than 50 hangers.  Constructed of durable coated steel, the Drying Center can support over 100lbs worth of laundry.  The large steel legs lock into place for maximum stability and have plastic feet that are contoured to protect floors.  When your laundry is dry, simply fold up the Drying Center and secure it with the strap for compact storage.  Air drying is a great way to reduce energy usage, cut utility bill costs and extend the life of garments.",
