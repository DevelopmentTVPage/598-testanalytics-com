    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Flushable Wipes Dispenser is the perfect way to keep flushable wipes fresh, accessible and discreet. The silicone gasket in the lid keeps wipes fresh and keeps them from drying out. The lid opens with a simple, one-handed push, and the internal weighted plate dispenses wipes one at a time. The non-slip feet keep the Wipes Dispenser in place, and its compact size allows it to fit neatly on the back of the toilet. The clear indicator window on the front of the Wipes Dispenser shows how many wipes are left, so you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time for a refill. The polished construction is easy to clean, and the Dispenser fits up to 60 flushable wipes.",
