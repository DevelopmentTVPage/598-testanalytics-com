    "description": "Cleaning is less of a chore with the OXO Good Grips Microfiber Hand Duster. This double-sided Duster features a flexible head with long, fluffy fibers that get into nooks and crannies and can remove dust from objects with a light touch. The Duster's slim profile can fit in tight spaces and the generous head covers a large surface with every swipe. To clean the microfiber head, simply unsnap it from the Duster. For best results, wash in cold water without fabric softener or bleach and dry without using heat. The Duster is machine-washable.",
