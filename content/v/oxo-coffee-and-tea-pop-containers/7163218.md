The Containers have a unique push-button mechanism that creates an airtight seal with just one touch. The button also serves as a handle to lift off the lid. The Containers are designed for modular stacking so that you can efficiently organize your countertop and pantry. In addition, with their square and rectangular shapes, the POP Containers make the most of any storage space, while their corners allow for easy pouring. These tinted POP Containers are available in 3 different sizes to fit any coffee beans, ground coffee, loose leaf tea, or any other UV-sensitive foods fresh. The lid comes apart for thorough cleaning. All POP Containers are BPA free.",
