    "description": "\"The strength of Pure\"\n\nThe overarching theme of the Braun brand today, \"The strength of pure,\" is rooted in over half a century of modern design. Starting in 1955, the Braun brothers, Fritz Eichler and Dieter Rams pioneered a new direction, and the resulting products introduced \"good design\" into our everyday lives. Certainly Braun products have evolved over the decades in appearance and technology, but the brand's core values of functionality, quality and aesthetics are as relevant today as they were 55 years ago, when Braun design was born.",
