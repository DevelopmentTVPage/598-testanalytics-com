    "description": "MRS. MEYER'S CLEAN DAY household products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had as idea: \"Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like a garden, but still work like the dickens on a daily dirt and grime.\" She named the product line after her very practical mom and the common sense values she passed along to her kids.",
