    "description": "Dust bunnies beware! The OXO Good Grips Microfiber Floor Duster has a wide 14\u201d head that makes dusting large areas quick and easy. The aluminum pole is lightweight for easy maneuvering, and the double-jointed head makes it easy to get around furniture and into narrow spaces. The durable microfiber material traps and holds dust without the use of additional cleaning chemicals. For best results, wash the microfiber head in cold water without fabric softener or bleach and dry without using heat. The Duster is machine-washable.",
