    "description": "Cuisinart engineering simplifies the art of baking the perfect pizzelle. The Cuisinart\u00ae Pizzelle Press makes two thin, crisp 4-inch cookies at once. Dual indicator lights provide easy operation and take the guesswork out of timing. Pizzelle can be baked at one of 5 browning levels. Nonstick plates let consumers remove warm pizzelle without breaking them, so they can be rolled for cannolis or cones. Plates wipe clean with a damp cloth, and the unit stands up for compact storage.",
