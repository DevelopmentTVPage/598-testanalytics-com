    "description": "This folding premium bamboo cutting board was designed with convenience and safety in mind. It is so compact it can be stored on its end with your cookbooks! Strategically placed heavy-duty magnets keep the tools secure in place to guard against them falling out. Magnets are also used to keep the folding book-style board securely closed. Measuring 9.5\" x 1.5\" x 11\", the Soiree features 145 sq. in. of surface space on its exterior lid. It also features a 6.25\" x 6.25\" stainless steel cutting plate inside, as well as a wire cheese slicer, and three brushed stainless steel cheese tools. Your guests will be impressed when you display the Soiree at your next dinner party or get-together!\n\nComponents:\n1 cheese shaver\/spatula\n1 fork-tipped cheese knife (with holes to prevent cheese from sticking to blade)\n1 cheese spreader",
