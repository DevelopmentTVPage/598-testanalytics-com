    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Wooden Reamer efficiently juices lemons, limes and other citrus fruits. The pointed tip and sharp edges make it easier to begin and continue the juicing process. The Reamer is made of solid beech wood, which does not react with acidic fruits, making the product more durable. We do not recommend washing your wooden tools in the dishwasher.",
