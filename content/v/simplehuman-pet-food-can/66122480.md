    "description": "Our pet food can has a robust lock-tight handle that keeps food in and pets out. A silicone gasket forms an airtight seal so food stays fresh. The can includes a convenient scoop that attaches magnetically under the lid. Its large capacity (40 lb\/15 kg) is also ideal for storing other types of bulk food items such as flour, rice, sugar, charcoal, or bird seed.",
