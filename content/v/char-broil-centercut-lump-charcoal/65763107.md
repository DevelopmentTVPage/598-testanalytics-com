    "description": "Cut only from the center of white hardwoods, Char-Broil CenterCut Lump Charcoal is 100% organic and is never made from hardwood scrap.  \n\nModel # 8996514\n\nThe average lump size is 3\u201d.  \n\nUniform sizing helps to ensure that each lump is carbonized equally and burns with little variance in heat output.  \n\nConsistent sizing makes Char-Broil CenterCut easier for you to light, use in your grill, and ultimately achieve more-reliable results \u2013 from one box to the next.\n\nMost of the water and other natural wood components have been burned-away giving you the only lump charcoal that minimizes unwanted sparks when lighting.  \n\nYou will also find that this regulated manufacturing process has burned-away most of the smoke.  \n\nThis gives you the ability to control the quality of your smoke by adding Char-Broil wood chunks and chips  - in the flavor of YOUR choice, just like the top BBQ Pitmasters.",
