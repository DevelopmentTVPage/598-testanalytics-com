    "description": "Blendtec blades are made of cold-forged hardened steel and are up to 80% thicker and 10 times stronger than other blender blades. They're also blunt instead of sharp. Why? With a blade that spins over 300 miles per hour, it doesn't need to be sharp to get the job done. Instead of chipping away at ice and frozen fruit with sharp edges, the large, blunt design pulverizes virtually anything. And it\u2019s completely safe to clean, too.",
