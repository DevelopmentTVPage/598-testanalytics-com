    "description": "Deep-Frying consists of submerging uncooked or coated food in a large quantity of hot oil (170 to 180\u00b0C) so that it cooks to a crispy golden brown.     \n                                   \n For the shrimp tempura recipe, dip the shrimps' tails into a batter made up of flour, corn starch and ice water Then, carefully drop them one by one into the boiling oil. Shake the fry basket gently in order to keep the shrimp from sticking to the bottom. After cooking for 4 to 5 minutes, raise the fry basket out of the oil, to drain off the excess of oil and dry the shrimp on a paper towel. The shrimps' tails are tasty and tender.",
