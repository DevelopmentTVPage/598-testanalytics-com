    "description": "Many fan heaters have weak airflow. Instead of projecting warm air to every corner of the room they wheeze it out, and the air heads straight up to the ceiling. Most of the room is left cold.\n\nSome fan heaters claim to cool too, but many have the same problem; weak airflow, which means the air doesn\u2019t circulate around the room.\n\nBy iteratively refining the movement of air, Dyson engineers have developed a machine which can quickly switch between personal and full room heating in the winter, or cooling in the summer.\n\nOur latest technology tackles both. Now 75% quieter, AM09 uses Dyson\u2019s own Jet Focus technology. The machine switches between heating and cooling the whole room or focusing on just you.",
