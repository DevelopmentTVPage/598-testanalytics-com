    "description": "Making candy is sweeter with the OXO Good Grips Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer. This glass Thermometer is offset to allow for large, easy-to-read graphics, which include temperature ranges for different candy types. The measurement markings temperature within two degrees in F and C for accuracy. The convenient clip is extra long to make it easy to attach, remove or adjust, and the rounded foot helps prevent scratching on the sides or bottom of your pot. The large opening in the handle allows you to lift the Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer out of the pot using a utensil, and the durable, stainless steel body is easy to clean. This Thermometer isn\u2019t just for candy! It\u2019s also great for measuring oil temperature for deep frying, and for making jellies and jams.",
