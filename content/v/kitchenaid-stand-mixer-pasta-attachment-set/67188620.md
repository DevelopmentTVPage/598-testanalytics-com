Our special set includes three attachments for rolling and cutting pasta dough: a roller, fettuccine cutter and spaghetti cutter. \n\nThe roller makes sheets of pasta, including egg noodles and lasagna. An adjustment knob lets you knead dough quickly and work it to the desired thickness. The fettuccine cutter cuts sheets produced by the roller into fettuccine noodles. The linguine cutter lets you cut pasta into thin noodles; very thin sheets can be cut into angel-hair pasta.\n\nFor more about Sur La Table, visit www.surlatable.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/SurLaTableCorp\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/surlatable\/\n\nPin us on Pinterest:\nhttp:\/\/pinterest.com\/surlatable\/\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Sur_La_Table",
