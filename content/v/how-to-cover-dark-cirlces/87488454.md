    "description": "To cover dark circles caused by tired eyes, the first tip is to use a concealer that gets the job done. The Neutrogena HealthySkin Brightening Eye Perfector is a great go-to because of its lightweight liquid formula that makes it great for layering. \n\nStep 1: Start by applying concealer to the upper eye area in a backwards C formation. \n\nStep 2: Pat with ring finger. The heat from your finger will help blend the product seamlessly. \n\nStep 3: If you need more coverage, repeat this step until you see no more dark circles.\n\nFollow our \u2018How To\u2019 series for more everyday makeup tips!",
