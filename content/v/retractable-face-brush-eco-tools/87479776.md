    "description": "Apply foundation, bronzer, blush, and highlighter on-the-go with the EcoTools Retractable Brush. Twist up the makeup brush for on-the-go touch ups and throw it in your bag with the cap for mess-free storage.\n\nFor a quick touch-up or as your travel makeup brush, use the Retractable Brush for a flawless finish with powders and bronzers. Throughout the face apply powder in circular motions for perfect coverage. Add blush to the apples of cheeks for a pop of color. Bring a slight shimmer to the face by brushing on highlighter on the upper cheekbones, brows, nose, and chin. Create a warm glow on the skin with some bronzer under the cheekbones, by the hairline, and under the jawline. Throw on the cap to take the Retractable Brush with you wherever you go!",
