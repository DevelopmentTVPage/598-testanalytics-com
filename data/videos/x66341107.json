    "description": "One balloon and a couple of evenings after work - Dyson engineers show how inducement and entrainment works on the Dyson Air Multiplier fan. If you watch closely, the balloon is sucked into the airflow from behind and to the side of the fan; this is inducement and entrainment of the air.\n\nLots of experimentation with different sized balloons and other objects produced this video. And although edited to include our successful attempts, the video is made from completely genuine footage (and no, the balloon isn't attached to anything).",
