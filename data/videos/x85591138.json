    "description": "Imagine fresh herbs and vegetables grown in your home, year-round. With the Miracle-Gro AeroGarden Harvest you can grow fresh herbs, vegetables, salad greens, flowers and more! This smart countertop garden uses water and patented nutrients to naturally grow plants... no herbicides, no pesticides, non-GMO. It's natural goodness right at your fingertips.\n\nAeroGardens are the world's leading indoor gardening systems. You can grow up to 6 plants in this garden and they'll love the 20 watts of high performance, energy efficient LED lighting. The LED lights are tuned to the specific spectrum that allows plants to maximize photosynthesis, resulting in rapid, natural growth and abundant harvests. The LED lights concentrate daylight white LEDs for fast growth, blue LEDs for bigger yields, and red LEDs for more flowers and fruit. With ideal lighting and optimally balanced levels of water and nutrients, plants grow up to 5 times faster than when grown in soil.\n\nThe Harvest's easy-to-use LCD control panel utilizes simple prompts to guide you from setup to harvest. It also creates optimal conditions for your plants by automatically turning the lights on and off and reminding you when to add water and nutrients.",
