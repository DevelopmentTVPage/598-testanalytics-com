As the inventor of the cleaning center, Braun has more than 10 years of experience in the area. This is why Braun is the only brand using alcohol cleaning fluid which eliminates 99.999% of all germs and bacteria in every cleaning process. Tests have shown that using the cleaning center is 10 times more hygienic than simply rinsing it under tap water. A Clean & Renew\u2122 refill cartridge should be replaced around 4 times a year and makes your shaver feel like new every day.\r\n*790cc and 760cc only",
