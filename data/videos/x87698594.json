    "description": "Dirty dishes are a pain, especially when your detergent doesn't get them completely clean the first time -- or you get stuck with grimy, soapy residue. But maybe your dishwasher detergent just needs a boost from OxiClean -- because we know how to wash dishes.\n\nJust add a squirt of OxiClean Dishwashing Booster to the bottom of the dishwasher, run as normal, and let it go to work for you cleaning your dirty dishes. They'll come out sparkling.\n\nDo you ever wash your dishes before you run them in the dishwasher -- or worse, after you take them out? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nCheck our YouTube channel to learn more about how OxiClean gets the tough stains out, and cleans like no other.
