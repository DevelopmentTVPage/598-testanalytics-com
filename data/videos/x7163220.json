    "description": "With the OXO Good Grips Cherry & Olive Pitter, baking cherry pies, canning cherries and making homemade preserves is no longer the pits. The Pitter features a removable splatter shield that directs juices downward and prevents them from soiling your work area. When not in use, the splatter shield fits inside the front chamber and a lock holds the Pitter closed for convenient storage. Sturdy, die-cast zinc construction removes pits with ease, and soft, comfortable non-slip handles absorb pressure while you squeeze. The holder is extra large to accommodate Bing cherries and has a recessed cup to securely hold smaller varieties when pitting. Also try the Pitter to prepare fresh cherries for small children. The Cherry & Olive Pitter should be placed in the dishwasher in its unlocked position.",
