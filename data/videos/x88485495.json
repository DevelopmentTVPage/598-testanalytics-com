    "description": "Water puddles staining the windowsill or floors, parquet or sensitive carpeting belong to the past. The window vacuum cleaner of Leifheit removes water, dirt and cleaning agent residues from the window after soaping it up and of course does all this without leaving any stripes at all! Owing to the automatic standby function, the window vacuum cleaner automatically enters the energy saving mode when it is not in use, for an extra-long battery durability. Also ideally suitable for mirrors, tiles, shower cabins and all smooth surfaces. The handy tool can be combined with all Leifheit click-system handles. Therefore, winter gardens or roof windows can also be cleaned without streaks and drips.",
