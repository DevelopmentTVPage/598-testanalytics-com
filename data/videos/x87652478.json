    "description": "When we were kids we loved to make things. But somewhere along the way we just stopped. Maybe it\u2019s the fear that the things we make might not turn out perfect. At Mrs. Meyer\u2019s, we believe that the world would be a better place if everyone were a maker. So we decided to do something about it. On Saturday, September 24th, we took making to the streets \u2014 literally \u2014 with the first ever VW Thing car and trailer that transformed into a making workshop at the Chicago Randolph Street Market. A lot of people had a lot of fun making crafts that day. Of course, not everything they made turned out perfect, but we think that\u2019s kind of perfect. The fun is in the making. For more inspiration head to our website and don\u2019t forget to share your own perfectly imperfect creations with #MakeAndTell.",
