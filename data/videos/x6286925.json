    "description": "Dyson's Tangle-free Turbine tool uses two counter-rotating heads with brushes to remove hair and dirt, sucking it straight into the bin - hygienically. \n\nDyson has an unforgiving test team who are tasked with finding fault in all of Dyson's technology. Human hair, pet hair, synthetic hair, thread, string, ribbon - watch Dyson engineers put the Tangle-free Turbine tool to the test. But will it tangle? \n\nWarning: This video was created and executed by Dyson engineers in a controlled environment, putting the Tangle-Free Turbine tool to extreme use. Please always take care and follow all safety precautions when using this or any other Dyson product.",
