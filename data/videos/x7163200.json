    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Folding Clip Dryer is a convenient way to air dry items that cannot be put in the dryer, such as underwear and lingerie. It's also strong enough to hang and dry heavier items such as jeans.  The lightweight Dryer uses three hooks to mount easily on a shower curtain rod or a rod in the laundry room. It features 14 clips with non-slip grips.  The clips are attached directly to the rust proof aluminum rail.  This provides easy access to the clip grips for fast opening and loading, and ensures the clips will not get tangled in storage.  The Dryer folds in half and snaps closed for compact storage and the folded Dryer can be hung conveniently in a closet.   This folding feature also allows the Dryer to hang on curved or corner shower rods.  The OXO Good Grips Folding Clip Dryer is an ideal way to protect delicates, but is also great for reducing energy usage, cutting utility bill costs and extending the life of garments.",
