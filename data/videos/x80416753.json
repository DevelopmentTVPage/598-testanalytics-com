The 4-serving area of the grill is ideal for burgers and chicken for the whole family, or for a smaller meal complete with grilled vegetables. The improved George Tough non-stick coating is 3x more durable than previous models, and removes the need for excess oil and butter. Plus, removable grill plates are dishwasher-safe, making cleanup that much easier.",
