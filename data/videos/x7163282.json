    "description": "The case of the runaway veggies has just been solved. The OXO Good Grips Chop & Pour Cutting Board makes chopping and transporting ingredients simple and efficient. Use the Board's corner spout to neatly guide food from the Board directly into bowls, pots or pans without spilling onto stovetops or counters. A generous, flat cutting surface allows for efficient slicing and dicing, while the raised back and side walls keep food contained.  The lightweight Board and soft, tapered handles make lifting easy. The Board is made of durable, non-porous, odor-resistant polypropylene that resists deep scratches and won't dull sharp knives and non-slip edges keep the Board from slipping.  Dishwasher safe.",
