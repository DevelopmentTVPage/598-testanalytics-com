    "description": "Dyson's AM01 table fan is designed for personal cooling and for cooling smaller spaces.  It uses patented Air Multiplier technology to generate powerful airflow and velocity to cool you effectively.  No fast-spinning blades mean no unpleasant buffeting and it is safe for children and pets. And no dusty grilles or blades make it easy to clean. The AM01 has an energy efficient brushless motor.  Easy touch-tilt, smooth 90\u00b0 oscillation and dimmer-switch provide precise control. It is easy to assemble, and has LED on\/off control for use in the dark. AM01 comes with a 2 year warranty, parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson.",
