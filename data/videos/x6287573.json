    "description": "Simply lift the OXO Good Grips Uplift Tea Kettle by its handle and the spout opens automatically! No awkward buttons or levers, just lift and pour! The spout stays in the open position for safe and precise pouring. The soft, non-slip handle is heat-resistant for added safety, and a large lid makes the Uplift easy to fill and easy to clean. With a polished stainless steel finish, this Kettle is attractive, durable and stain resistant. The Kettle has a whistle to let you know when your water is ready and has a 1.7-quart capacity.",
