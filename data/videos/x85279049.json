    "description": "Bringing together 250 years of design heritage and contemporary styling, Wedgwood presents the \u2018Gilded Muse\u2019 gifting collection.\n\nThe late eighteenth century fashion for neo-classicism brought the ancient art of Greece and Rome to British design. Josiah Wedgwood, ever at the forefront of trends, embraced this new style producing decorative designs for the home which plundered the numerous episodes of these ancient civilisations.\n\nGilded Muse celebrates this body of work of iconic pieces, taking its essence and transforming it for the contemporary audience. It represents an entirely new approach to gifting, offering fine bone china designs which blend the contemporary with the classic for a luxurious update for the table and wider home interiors.",
