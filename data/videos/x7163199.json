    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Food Mill is the perfect tool for preparing fresh purees, sauces, soups and more. It has a stainless steel inner bowl that is ideal for hot foods and will not stain, and includes three stainless steel grinding discs for fine, medium and coarse textures. Use the fine disc for homemade jellies, creamy sauces and baby food, the medium disc for applesauce and vegetable soups, and the coarse disc for mashed potatoes and chunkier sauces. The Food Mill has a unique release button that makes it easy to exchange discs and disassemble for storage. Three non-slip legs hold the Food Mill securely over bowls and pots up to 11 inches in diameter, keeping it out of your food. The legs also fold for easy storage. The soft, non-slip handle and knob ensure comfort when gripping the Food Mill and turning the blade. All parts are dishwasher-safe.",
