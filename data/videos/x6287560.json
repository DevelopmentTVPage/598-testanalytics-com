Pour your gravy into the Separator and watch the fat rise to the top while lean gravy settles to the bottom. The heat-resistant strainer catches unwanted bits, and the stopper prevents fat from rising to the top of the spout. Once the gravy has settled, remove the strainer and the stopper and pour out perfect gravy; a shield prevents the gravy from spilling over the top of the Separator instead of through the spout. This heat-resistant Fat Separator has measurement markings for increased convenience and a non-slip handle for a comfortable, firm grip.",
