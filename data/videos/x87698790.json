    "description": "Dyson's most efficient cyclones capture more dust, dirt and microscopic particles than any other cyclone.\n\nOther vacuums lose suction, leaving more and more microscopic dust particles and allergens in your home. But with Dyson Cinetic\u2122 vacuums, 36 Dyson Cinetic\u2122 tips oscillate at up to 5000Hz, separating the microscopic dust that clogs other vacuums. There\u2019s no need to wash or replace a filter, and there's no loss of suction.\n\nDyson have engineered the only vacuum that gets back up when toppled. Others vacuums fall down and stay down. Only Dyson Big Ball cylinder vacuums pick themselves up.\n\nDyson Big Ball Cylinder vacuums also feature an articulated handle for easy, versatile cleaning\nThe wand\u2019s handle now rotates in three directions, allowing full 360\u00b0 articulation for greater control.\n\nThere is also a larger, high-capacity bin which is 33% bigger than previous Dyson Cinetic\u2122 cylinder vacuums.",
