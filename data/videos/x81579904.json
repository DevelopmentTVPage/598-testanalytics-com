    "description": "This compact Drying Rack features two cleaning brushes specifically designed for breast pump parts that store compactly inside and stand up automatically when the Rack is opened. The loop brush is perfect for breast shields, valves and connectors, while the detail brush is great for threads and other intricate spaces. The elevated ridges keep parts elevated above water for quick drying.",
