    "description": "To explore the technology behind the latest Dyson Digital Slim cordless vacuum cleaner\n\nThe new Dyson Digital Slim DC59 Animal is powered by the Dyson digital motor V6. Running at up to 110,000rpm, this works with our 2 Tier Radial cyclone technology and a re-engineered nickel manganese cobalt battery to provide powerful, constant suction. The latest motorised head with carbon fibre filaments aids in achieving high dust removal. Together these four technologies enable DC59 Animal to suck up as much dust as even a corded vacuum and delivers 3 times the suction of any other cordless vacuum cleaner.",
