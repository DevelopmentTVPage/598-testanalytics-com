    "description": "The OXO Flip & Fold Omelet Turner is the ideal shape and size for making the perfect omelet. The flexible head and edges conform to rounded pans, allowing the Turner to easily glide under the entire omelet. The wide shape and soft, comfortable handle provide structure and control to flip or fold omelets while keeping them intact.  The silicone head is heat resistant up to 600\u00b0F, safe for non-stick cookware and dishwasher safe. The Omelet Turner is also great for making quesadillas and more!",
