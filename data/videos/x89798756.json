See how L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s been through it all including the birth of hairspray. \n\nThe 20\u2019s saw women\u2019s hairstyles that were soft and high. Then in the 30\u2019s finger curls rolled through the decade. In the 40\u2019s the first aerosol spray was created during WWII to spray the troops with insect repellent to prevent malaria. The 50\u2019s birthed the term \u201chairspray\u201d as well as L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA as Cosmair, short for cosmetics for hair. Nationally in the 60\u2019s, hairsprays outsold lipsticks. The 70\u2019s were marked by statement afros. In the 80\u2019s L\u2019Or\u00e9al invented the first styling mousse \u201cfree hold style mousse\u201d at the same time the modern curling iron was invented. Back in the 90\u2019s the flat iron made it\u2019s debut and L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s studio line made waves. Today no matter the style, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris keeps it on trend.",
