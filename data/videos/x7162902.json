    "description": "A delicious cup of coffee is art and science combined; the art of extracting rich flavors and aromas from coffee grounds, and the science of time and temperature colliding in just the right way, at just the right moment. The OXO Barista Brain Coffee Maker heats water to the optimal temperature to help your favorite roast reach its full potential, and precisely maintains that temperature throughout the entire brewing process. Water is pumped to the brew basket in perfectly timed cycles, starting with a short cycle that allows coffee to bloom for full flavor extraction. The intelligent microprocessor monitors time, temperature and volume from start to finish, ensuring the precision of hand-crafted coffee with the ease of ordering at your favorite local coffee shop. You choose the number of cups and we\u2019ll do the rest, creating a pot of perfection every time.",
