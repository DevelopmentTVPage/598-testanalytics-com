    "description": "If you're up on food trends, you know all about the Ramen Burger. \n\nThis is how to make a ramen burger in the Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker. \n\nFirst, cook the ramen noodles as you normally would. (Be sure to use the flavor packet for extra flavor.)\n\nThen, drain and mix the cooked ramen with a beaten egg and divide into the bottom cooking areas. The cooking rings act as a mold, holding the ramen noodles and egg mixture together in the shape of a bun.\n\nAfter about 8 minutes, flip the ramen bun over to crisp up the other side. Flip down the cooking plates and crack an egg on one. Place a pre-cooked burger patty on the other along with a slice of cheese. Close the lid and cook an additional 2 minutes. \n\nSlide out the cooking trays, dropping the burger and egg onto the ramen bun. Top with scallions, arugula and sriracha ketchup and assemble the burger. \n\nThen, enjoy your masterpiece.",
