    "description": "\"Braising\" is a cooking method consisting of browning food using fat or oil before adding a liquid and covering in order to cook slowly over low heat. \n\nFor the beef cheek's recipe, it's important to heat the pan, add a little oil along with a clove of garlic and sear the meat. Next, add some carrots and onions and then dust the meat with flour until they are completely covered.  Mix all the ingredients in order to coat them with the flour. Cover and allow to simmer on the stove top over low heat or in the oven at 160-170\u00b0C for 1 1\/2 to 2 hours, checking regularly as it cooks.",
