    "description": "No more running jars under hot water, banging them on the counter or asking someone for help. The OXO Good Grips Jar Opener is the perfect tool for easily opening all size jars, from small condiment bottles to large tubs of mayonnaise. The innovative base pad reduces the force required to open a jar by keeping the jar secure on the countertop. Simply place the non-slip base pad under the jar, slide the Jar Opener over the jar lid, and twist counter-clockwise to loosen the lid. The non-slip base pad securely attaches to the Jar Opener for storage.",
