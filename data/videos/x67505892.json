    "description": "The Griddler\u00ae Deluxe by Cuisinart\u00ae takes grilling to new heights! It offers six enticing cooking options. The reversible grill and griddle plates, combined with dual-zone temperature control, give home chefs complete control. This grill is perfect for making pancakes and eggs for breakfast, panini and open-faced sandwiches for lunch, and burgers or fajitas for dinner. The extra-large grilling surface is ideal for entertaining a crowd or making family meals. The new SearBlast\u2122 feature locks in the flavor of steaks. With dishwasher-safe accessories, an elegant new look, and 1800 watts of power, DELUXE is an understatement!",
