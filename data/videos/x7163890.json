    "description": "Using The Digital Food Thermometer On The Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Big Easy 2-in-1 Electric Smoker & Roaster\n\nWith The Big Easy, food is done once it reaches proper internal temperature. Always use the Digital Food Thermometer to monitor internal temperature. \n\nFor the most accurate results, insert the probe into the thickest part of the food - not touching bone, fat or gristle before lowering into the cook chamber. Place the digital food thermometer cord to the left side of the cooking chamber before closing lid and inserting into the Jack.\n\nSet the target temperature using the USDA guidelines printed inside the back cover of the product guide as a reference.\n\nThe Big Easy will monitor the internal temperature of food being cooked and power-off automatically once the set target temperature is reached.\n\nAfter cooking, check the temperature in several places to make sure the food is evenly heated. Use caution when doing this as the thermometer may be hot.\n\nMake sure to clean your food thermometer with hot, soapy, water before and after each use. Do not immerse it in water or wash it in the dishwasher.",
