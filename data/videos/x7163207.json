The Boards feature soft, tapered handles for easy lifting and carrying and non-slip edges that keep the Boards securely in place during use. The Boards are available in three sizes for all food preparation tasks. Carve your next roast on the Carving and Cutting Board. All Boards have juice grooves on one side that retain liquids; use the grooved side for meats and the solid side for vegetables to prevent cross contamination. Or, use different colored Boards for different tasks at hand. The Boards are made of durable, non-porous, odor-resistant polypropylene that resists deep scratches and won't dull sharp knives. Boards are dishwasher safe.",
