    "description": "This video shows how to solve mobility issues for your iRobot\u00ae Braava jet\u2122 Mopping Robot. Turn the robot upside down, and clean the cliff detect sensors on the front and back of the robot with a clean, dry cloth. Tap the bumper a few times to clear any debris. Check the wheels for any obstacles and clear away any hair or debris that has built up. Lastly, check to make sure the Braava jet\u2122 pad has not been damaged. If it has, switch to a new Braava jet\u2122 pad.",
