    "description": "Whether you're rinsing berries for a snack or making pasta for the family, the 3 Piece Nesting Bowl & Colander Set has the tool for the job. Bowl and Colander nest for compact storage, so they don't take up a lot of space in your cabinets. The Bowl features a non-slip bottom for stability while mixing and dual tone colors provide kitchen-to-table appeal. The curved Bowl has no internal angles or corners, ensuring efficient mixing and easy cleaning. The Colander has an elevated ring along the bottom to keep it stable in the sink or on the countertop and elongated holes for fast, efficient draining. The lid seals the Bowl for convenient food storage in the fridge, or rests on nested Bowl and Colander to stack while storing.  Bowl, Colander and lid are dishwasher safe.",
