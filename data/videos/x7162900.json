    "description": "A truly perfect brew starts with ground coffee, but it takes the right grinder to help coffee beans unlock their full flavor potential. The Barista Brain Grinder\u2019s intelligent, built-in scale precisely measures coffee using the pre-set grams-to-cup ratios; if you prefer to customize, you can use the gram setting to create your own coffee ratio and grind based on weight. The Grinder\u2019s high torque\/low speed DC motor helps keep beans from overheating while grinding, creates a consistent and uniform grind for optimal flavor extraction, and generates minimal static to reduce mess. Whether you like strong or weak, espresso or drip, French Press or pour over, the OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder can help you get the grounds you need to make your perfect cup.",
