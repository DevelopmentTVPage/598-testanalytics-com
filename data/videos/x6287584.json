    "description": "Removing corn kernels from cobs has never been easier. The OXO Good Grips Corn Stripper features a container that catches the kernels as they are stripped from the cob. Simply push the Corn Stripper down the length of the cob and the kernels collect in a convenient \u00bd-cup capacity container. Turn the cob and continue stripping until all kernels are removed. Kernels can be poured out of the top hole of the container into a bowl or onto a plate. The soft, non-slip grips cushion your hand during use and the stainless steel blade will not rust or dull. The Corn Stripper comes apart for easy cleaning and all parts are dishwasher safe.",
