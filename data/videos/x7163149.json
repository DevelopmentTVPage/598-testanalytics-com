    "description": "http:\/\/www.oxo.com\/p-737-wire-cheese-slicer-with-replaceable-wires.aspx\n\nSlicing cheese just got easier with the OXO Good Grips Wire Cheese Slicer with Replaceable Wires. The stainless steel wire is easy to load and is tightened into place with the convenient tensioning wheel. The tensioning wheel can also be used to tighten wires that loosen over time. The sturdy, die-cast zinc construction and the soft, comfortable handle allow you to easily pull the wire through medium and hard cheeses. Adjust the angle of your wrist to change from thick to thin cheese slices. The Wire Cheese Slicer is dishwasher safe and includes one stainless steel replacement wire in the package.",
