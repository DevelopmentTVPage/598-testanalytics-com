    "description": "Seasoning The Cooking Chamber Of The Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Big Easy 2-in-1 Electric Smoker & Roaster\n\nJust like a cast iron skillet, the stainless steel cooking chamber must be seasoned prior to use. This is most important as it will allow the cooking chamber to function properly. In addition, it will make cleaning easier and inhibit rusting. \n\nCoat all interior surfaces of the cooking chamber with vegetable oil. If you use a vegetable spray, wipe down the cooking chamber after spraying to ensure an even coat. Turn The Big Easy on, set the Power Level to (15), close the lid and allow it to heat until the vegetable oil burns off and stops smoking. The shiny finish of the stainless steel cooking chamber should now have a very dark brown or bronze color. \n\nYou are now ready to cook. The more you use your Big Easy, the better it will cook. The darker, more-seasoned, the cooking chamber becomes the hotter and the more evenly it will cook. A light coat of vegetable oil before each use will keep the surfaces seasoned and help prevent any rusting.",
